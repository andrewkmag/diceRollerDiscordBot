# diceRollerBot
> A simple bot that performs "checks" on a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. To "Pass" the check, the roll of the dice(s) must have a value greater than or equal to the generated number. Conversely to "fail" a check means rolling dice(s) whose value is less than the generated number. Modifiers are optional to affect the value of the dice roll.
