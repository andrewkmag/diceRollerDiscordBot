# diceRollerBot

> A simple discord bot that performs "checks" on a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. To "Pass" the check, the roll of the dice(s) must have a value greater than or equal to the generated number. Conversely to that to "fail" a check means rolling dice(s) whose value is less than the generated number. Modifiers (to affect the value of the dice roll) are [planned to be] toggable and based on a successful or failed check can result in general changes to user's nickname, roles and permissions are [planned to be] toggable.
